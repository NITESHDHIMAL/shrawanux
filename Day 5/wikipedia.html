                <hr>
                <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where they had earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
                    date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
                    settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[33]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[35][34] the first
                    urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
                    have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern
                    Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is
                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[40]


                    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple, is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in
                    Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
                    By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[41] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[42] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[43] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
                    prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka
                    and his daughter, Sita.</p>

                    Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120
                    mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and
                    longitudes 80° and 89°E. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the
                    Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused
                    by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[76] Simultaneously, the
                    vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[76] These
                    dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused
                    the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[76] The
                    rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late
                    as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the
                    western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest
                    gorges.[77] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that
                    rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[78] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[79] Nepal
                    lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan
                    arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas,[80][81][82][83][84][85] with a
                    small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the
                    northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[77]


                    Mount Everest, the highest peak on earth, lies on the Nepal–China border.
                    Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as Himal–Pahad–Terai.[g] Himal is
                    the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the
                    northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848.86 metres
                    (29,032 ft) height Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the
                    world's "eight-thousanders" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu,
                    Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. Pahad is the mountain region that does not
                    generally contain snow.
